# Thanks
This game is inspired by a small indie game I played a long time ago. It had a similar game mechanic of coupling the speed to the altitude. Unfortunately I cannot remember the name of that game, but it was awesome, thanks a lot!

Also a big thanks to the content creators offering their work for free in the Unity asset store!
